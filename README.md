### Acknowledgement

This is my first Javascript project that relies on graphics, and a part of the inspiraton towards making such a mini-project came from a very ellaborate and interesting video lecture series by [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).
I was inspired to try out this by one of their [guest tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1TQCi9axzg&t=449s) conducted by [Emily Xie](http://xie-emily.com).

I would like to thank Coding Train for continuing to educate and share their knowledge, helping a lot of aspirants like me to search out the vast possibilites of coding in general.
